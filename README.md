Abstract: A multi-layer feedforward neural network model with 4 hidden layers that consists of 100 neurons each with an activation function of ReLU. The output layer consists of 10 nodes that is converted to one-hot coded. The accuracy of the model reached 99.65% but it does not do well in classifying flush, straight flush, and royal flush.
